# Ramp Instant SDK

`@ramp-network/ramp-instant-sdk` is a library that allows you to easily integrate the Ramp widget into your web app and communicate with it.

It's not necessary to use it, although it's strongly recommended.

It's written with TypeScript, so you get all of the typings out of the box - always up-to-date.
